        <h4>Solar PV Panels:</h4>
        Solar PV panels absorb energy from the sun and convert it to electricity. Once installed, this electriity is
        completely free for you to use. It connects directly to your house's electricity network so you don't have
        to do anything extra to make use of this electricity. Any electricity generated by your solar panels that you
        don't use can be sold back to the National Grid. Depending on your tariff you could be paid as high as 20p/kwh.
        This will appear as a discount on your energy bill. If you install solar PV panels today, they are likely to 
        repay themselves in approximately 10 years. Modern PV panels have a life expectancy of up to 25 years so for 
        more than half of your panels' lifespan, they will be making you money.
        <br> <br>

        <h4>Air Souce Heat Pumps: </h4>
        Air source heat pumps are a kind of renewable energy technology that take the warmth from the air outside
        (even when it’s cold out) and use it to heat the home. You can get other heat pumps that do the same thing
        using the warmth in the ground and in water, but air source heat pumps are suitable for a wider range of
        properties. Heat pumps produce lower temperature hot water than a gas boiler so you are likely to need to
        install larger radiators. However, once this is done, you're home can be heated the same temperature as you
        are used to with a gas boiler. By extracting heat from the surroundings, a heat pump can produce heat up to
        three to five times the amount of electrical energy being put in. This makes them extremely efficient.
        <br> <br>

        <h4>Solar Thermal Panels:</h4>
        Solar water heating systems use panels or tubes, called solar collectors, to gather solar energy. The solar
        collectors convert the infra-red portion of visible light into heat. They are filled with a mix of water and
        glycol. This fluid is pumped around a circuit, which passes through your hot water cylinder. This fluid never
        comes into direct contact with the hot water you use. During summer this is likely to provide all of the hot
        water you need for free. Once installed this technology will last for up to 30 years with only minimal
        maintenance required.
        <br> <br>

        <h4>Green Home Grants:</h4>
        To encourage households to improve the efficiency of their homes, the government is offering up to £5000 in grants 
        to help pay for improvements. This can be spent on a range of green improvements including the installation of an
        air source heat pump, solar thermal panels, or new insulation measures. These subsidies are no longer available for 
        installing solar PV panels but these are now cheap enough to repay themselves over a period of approximately 10 years.
        <br><br>

        <h4>Gas Boilers:</h4>
        If you decide to replace your gas boiler, be aware that the efficiency value advertised for a new boiler can
        be misleading. A modern condenser boiler is able to operate at an efficiency level of around 90%. However, this
        is only the case under certain conditions. In reality, this efficiency level can be as low as 60%, making it more 
        expensive to heat your home.
        <br><br>

        <h4>Carbon Emissions:</h4>
        A 4 person house using grid electricity and a gas boiler to heat their home will produce approximately 10 tonnes of 
        carbon over 5 years. This is equivalent to driving nearly 25,000 miles in a petrol powered car or the amount of carbon
        absorbed by 165 tree seedlings growing for 10 years.
